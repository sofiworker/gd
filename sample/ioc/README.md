### IOC and DI

if you are 'javer', you always use `spring` for development, `spring` is famous for controlling reversal and dependencies.

now use golang, if you find a framework which like `spring`, the `wire` and `fx` is a good idea.

`Wire` is a static di framework

> Compile-time Dependency Injection for Go

`fx` is a runtime di framework, you can choose by yourself


but i think if you use golang as devlep maybe don't use these frameworks, these also make project be complicated.
